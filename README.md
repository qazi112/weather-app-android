# weather-app-android

I have tried to make almost replica of Xioami MI 11 Lite weather app UI.

At start i added a vertical scroll view and then inserted Constraint Layout as my main layout inside scroll view (vertical).
I used few linear layouts in side constraint layout.
As there is hourly data present in one api call, so i created UI for that as well on same main activity. it's a horizontal scroll and i have commented the xml which can be easily understood.
Below are images of Mi 11 Lite weather app.

--- Some Extra Details ---


  Few Strings were constant so i added them in strings.xml file
  As Primary color was white, so i used @color/white
  Few Transparent/low Opacity backgrounds are created and used - created as filename.xml in drawables
  All SVG images are used and are added in drawables as vector assets.
